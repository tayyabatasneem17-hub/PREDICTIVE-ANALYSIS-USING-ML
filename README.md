Task-2: Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

üìå About the Task

This task focuses on building a predictive machine learning model that can forecast outcomes based on historical data. Predictive analysis is one of the most widely used branches of machine learning, as it helps in identifying future trends, behaviors, or outcomes using patterns found in data. In this task, I developed a classification model using the Iris dataset to predict flower species based on their features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The objective was to understand the complete cycle of machine learning: feature selection, data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation.


‚öô Tools and Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas ‚Üí data manipulation and analysis
numpy ‚Üí numerical computations
matplotlib & seaborn ‚Üí data visualization and plotting
scikit-learn ‚Üí machine learning (data preprocessing, model building, evaluation)
Dataset: Iris dataset (can be replaced with custom datasets)
Editor Platform: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Version Control: GitHub (for code storage and sharing)



üîÑ Project Workflow

1. Dataset Loading: Imported the Iris dataset and converted it into a DataFrame.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Checked dataset structure, features, and target variable.
3. Feature Selection: Identified independent (X) and dependent (y) variables.
4. Data Splitting: Divided dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
5. Data Preprocessing: Applied StandardScaler to normalize features for better model performance.
6. Model Training: Trained a Logistic Regression model on the training set.
7. Prediction: Used the model to predict the test dataset outcomes.
8. Model Evaluation: Evaluated performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix visualization.



üåç Applications

Predictive analysis in healthcare (disease detection, patient outcome prediction)
Finance (loan approval prediction, fraud detection)
Marketing (customer churn prediction, product recommendation)
Education (student performance analysis)
General classification/regression tasks for any dataset




üíª Editor Platform

The project was executed in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the Python extension and Jupyter support for better visualization.
Required dependencies were installed using pip.
Results such as accuracy and confusion matrix were visualized directly in VS Code.
